This command-line based program rolls a user-defined dice sequence and
displays the result. The dices to roll are defined using dN where N is
the number of sides. Dices can be rolled multiple times by prepending
the number of repetitions (e.g., 3d6) and used in simple mathematical
expressions (e.g., 2d8+4).
